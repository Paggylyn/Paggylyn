DNI list:

- HAZBIN HOTEL / HELLUVA BOSS / DSMP / MHA / STEVEN UNIVERSE/ MELANIE MARTINEZ FANS DNI!!! Please and thank you <3
- If you're under 13,  please do not interact with me. As in, talk to me. I'm not patient with children on Pony Town. (then again, if you're that young I doubt you're going to be reading this. sighhhh)
- If you make fun of any religion at all. Just because you don't believe in said religion, doesn't mean you can make fun of it and disrespect it <3.
- Heavily political people. I'm not in the mood to talk about politics with anyone online.
- People that make fun of cis or straight people in general. YOU'RE ignorant  if you make fun of people just for their gender identity and sexuality, het or homo. Period.
- Homophobes or transphobes. Literally let people be and get a life.
- If you fake DID. I've only had to read one sourcebook on DID to know 90% of you guys are faking it. I can tell when you're faking it and I will not hesitate to point it out. Legit, some of you guys gaslight yourself into thinking you have it, going as far as to making up symptons. Get a life.
- King Henry VIII.

WARNING: Just as jesters, I tend to be sarcastic, sassy, and everything in between. Do keep in mind, I'm joking unless stated otherwise. Tell me if you need me to use tone tellers. I also get kinda frustrated when peope call jesters "clowns". There's a difference and I WILL correct you.

'BOUT ME:
- Hi, creatures, I'm Paggy or Pitaya. Both work just fine! 
  
- I'm a minor!!! Please don't be weird with me.

- hispanic and biligual (English and Spanish)

- autism + ADHD are bouncing about and around in my noggin.

- Might be a lesbian, might be a bisexual with a prefrence for women. Iono. I'm too young too know what the hell I am. So for now, I'm unlabeled. 
  
- I go by "She/her", but while cosplaying a character that goes by other pronouns, feel free to address me as such pronouns even when I'm out of character! 

- Big Will Wood fan. I can go on for hours about his music. 🐀🎹

- I'm called "jesterlovingfreak_24" , "Un-Lobotomizes", or "Paggygeek" in other socials, so if you find someone with those names, it MIGHT be me. Probably. 

- My interests are: DnD, CR:K / CR:OB, Deltarune, Undertale (and the AUs too), FNaF, history, jesters, marine animals-- especially Orcas! (I like a buncha fandom stuff so if it has a huge fandom, I probably know it)

- I like to write, draw, read, sculpt, and sew. (ASK ME FOR BOOK RECOMMENDATIONS PLEAAAAAASE)

PONY TOWN STUFF:

- I roleplay a lot. One of my natural habitats on PT is Kingdom roleplays. That's where you'll likely find me.

- Feel free to interact with me on Pony Town. If I don't respond, I'm probably afk because I like having Pony Town running in the background while I do schoolwork or while I write. So, if that's the case, just whisper me! 
- C + H is A-OKAY with me! Even if I don't have it in my name! And even if you're not my friend! >u<

- If you ever see me bullying someone, it's likely a friend, especially friends of mine like Zai, Ruki, or Cetrus <3.
