This person right here has attempted to defend blackface, tried to explain how shipping that heavily implies grooming of a minor until they were an adult was okay, lied about being a diagnosed system, and repeatedly called me a "bitch" even after I told them to stop many times because it made me severely uncomfortable. Please block and stay away. I am working on a calloout doc alongside other friends of mine. I also know this person in real life and have to, unfortunately, go to the same school as them. They also think they are a motherfucking angel now after previously telling me they were meant to be born as a zombie/wolf hybrid. Please stay away from this person and, if you can, block and hide if you stumble upon them in Pony Town. People like this are the reason Shadownilla is hated on even for people like me that only like AU's where the ship isn't toxic as hell.

- Kids under 14 DNI. Please. You guys are usually just a lot sometimes ðŸ˜¨

- I judge books by their cover, as in read through someone straw/rentry/etc, and block. I base this off red flags that I once ignored in people before that has led to arguments or drama, which I'm not a fan of at all. I just want to play the funny pixel horse game and talk to people with similar interests as me.

- There's someone out there calling me an ableist over a mild disagreement. Buddy I have diagnosed autism, innatentive ADHD, and GAD. They've also drawn children making out before. For more info, check out their tumblr and report it: https://www.tumblr.com/sugar-sharkie .
