'BOUT ME:
- Hi, creatures, I'm Paggy or Pitaya. Both work just fine! o(*￣▽￣*)ブ
  
- Minor / hispanic / biligual (English and Spanish) / autism + ADHD are bouncing about and around in my noggin / I don't have a label for my sexuality. (Not something I see necessary to label, if I'm being frank.)
  
- I go by "She/her", but while cosplaying a character that goes by other pronouns, feel free to address me as such pronouns! (≧∇≦)ﾉ

- Big Will Wood fan. I can go on for hours about his music. 🐀🎹

- I'm called "jesterlovingfreak_24" or "Paggygeek" in other socials, so if you find someone with those names, it MIGHT be me. Probably. :P

- My interests are: DnD, CR:K / CR:OB, Deltarune, Undertale (and the AUs too), FNaF, history, marine animals-- especially octupuses (NOT octopi. You say "octopuses" not "octopi". Octopi is incorrect! That's an archeic plural form of saying it!!!! /silly)╰（‵□′）╯

- I like to write, draw, read, and sew. (o′┏▽┓｀o)


PONY TOWN STUFF:

- I roleplay a lot. I like to say I'm experienced with all forms of roleplaying across different platforms, but really I've just been roleplaying online since I was around 9.ヾ(≧▽≦*)o

- Feel free to interact with me on Pony Town. If I don't respond, I'm probably afk because I like having Pony Town running in the background while I do schoolwork or while I write. So, if that's the case, just whisper me! ヾ(•ω•`)

- C + H is A-OKAY with me! Even if I don't have it in my name! And even if you're not my friend! > <
