 [Person](https://www.patreon.com/user/about?u=103974018), I'm not ableist. And if you have a problem with me, keep it with me. Don't harass my friends that weren't even involved. Leave them out of this. Talk with me instead of attacking my friends. I'm willing to explain, I'm willing to say anything you want me to say. Just stop attacking and stalking my friends. Last we talked, you were 18 years old and all of my friends are around 14-16, including myself. Please leave them alone if you're insistent on clinging onto your false accusations. Please, that's all I ask at least. If you hate drama so much, why do you have to go out of your way to attack my friends? Stop it. Leave them alone. Your problem is with me, not them. 
 


- Kids under 14 DNI. Please. You guys are usually just a lot sometimes ðŸ˜¨

- I judge books by their cover, as in read through someone straw/rentry/etc, and block. I base this off red flags that I once ignored in people before that has led to arguments or drama, which I'm not a fan of at all. I just want to play the funny pixel horse game and talk to people with similar interests as me.
