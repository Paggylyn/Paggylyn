 Btw, this person right here has attempted to defend blackface and shipping that involves an adult that knew someone since they were a child + lied about being a diagnosed system. Please block and stay away. I am working on a calloout doc alongside other friends of mine. I also know this person in real life and have to, unfortunately, go to the same school as them. Please stay away from this person.

- I judge books by their cover, as in read through someone straw/rentry/etc, and block. I base this off red flags that I once ignored in people before that has led to arguments or drama, which I'm not a fan of at all. I just want to play the funny pixel horse game and talk to people with similar interests as me.
