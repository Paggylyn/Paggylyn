"𝒩𝑜𝓉 𝑒𝓋𝑒𝓇𝓎 𝓆𝓊𝑒𝓈𝓉𝒾𝑜𝓃 𝒽𝒶𝓈 𝒶𝓃 𝒶𝓃𝓈𝓌𝑒𝓇."

DNI list:

- HAZBIN HOTEL / HELLUVA BOSS / DSMP / MHA / STEVEN UNIVERSE/ MELANIE MARTINEZ FANS DNI!!! Please and thank you <3
- If you're under 13,  please do not interact with me. As in, talk to me. I'm not patient with children on Pony Town. (then again, if you're that young I doubt you're going to be reading this. sighhhh)
- If you make fun of any religion at all. Just because you don't believe in said religion, doesn't mean you can make fun of it and disrespect it <3.
- Heavily political people. I'm not in the mood to talk about politics with anyone online.
- People that make fun of cis or straight people in general. I'm not cis nor straight, but I can gladly tell you that heterophobia/cisphobia is just as bad as homophobia. YOU'RE ignorant too if you make fun of people just for their gender identity and sexuality, het or homo. 

WARNING: I love you <3 You look awesome today btw.

By the way, visit my YouTube to see my art. I post a lot on the community and I also post CRK on YT Shorts some times. I'm planning on getting Tumblr once my parents let me :p. Until then, check out my YouTube to see sum art and stuff.

'BOUT ME:
- Hi, creatures, I'm Paggy or Pitaya. Both work just fine! o(*￣▽￣*)ブ
  
- I'm a minor!!! Please don't be weird with me.

- hispanic and biligual (English and Spanish)

- autism + ADHD are bouncing about and around in my noggin.

- I don't have a label for my sexuality. (Not something I see necessary to label, if I'm being frank. Also the fact I have better things to think about. I kiss whoever I want)
  
- I go by "She/her", but while cosplaying a character that goes by other pronouns, feel free to address me as such pronouns even when I'm out of character! (≧∇≦)ﾉ

- Big Will Wood fan. I can go on for hours about his music. 🐀🎹

- I'm called "jesterlovingfreak_24" or "Paggygeek" in other socials, so if you find someone with those names, it MIGHT be me. Probably. :P

- My interests are: DnD, CR:K / CR:OB, Deltarune, Undertale (and the AUs too), FNaF, history, jesters, marine animals-- especially Orcas! (I like a buncha fandom stuff so if it has a huge fandom, I probably know it)

- I like to write, draw, read, and sew. (o′┏▽┓｀o)

PONY TOWN STUFF:

- I roleplay a lot. I like to say I'm experienced with all forms of roleplaying across different platforms, but really I've just been roleplaying online since I was around 9.ヾ(≧▽≦*)o

- Feel free to interact with me on Pony Town. If I don't respond, I'm probably afk because I like having Pony Town running in the background while I do schoolwork or while I write. So, if that's the case, just whisper me! ヾ(•ω•`)

- C + H is A-OKAY with me! Even if I don't have it in my name! And even if you're not my friend! >u<

- If you ever see me bullying someone, it's likely a friend, especially friends of mine like Lotus <3
