### Look at my strawpage, eheh... ðŸ˜Ž (it's still a work in progress. Right now it's a template. But feel free to draw me smt! I live off of people's drawings. It's what fuels me.)

## ATTENTION: Copy my skins without my permission, and I'll pesonally dismember you medieval style.

 [Person](https://www.patreon.com/user/about?u=103974018), I'm not ableist. And if you have a problem with me, keep it with me. Don't harass my friends that weren't even involved. Leave them out of this. Talk with me instead of attacking my friends. I'm willing to explain, I'm willing to say anything you want me to say. Just stop attacking my friends. You're 18 years old and all of my friends are around 14-16, including myself. Please leave them alone if you're insistent on clinging onto your false accusations. Please, that's all I ask at least. If you hate drama so much, why do you have to go out of your way to attack my friends? Stop it. Leave them alone. Your problem is with me, not them.


- Kids under 13 DNI. Please.

- I judge books by their cover, as in read through someone straw/rentry/etc, and block. I base this off red flags that I once ignored in people before that has led to arguments or drama, which I'm not a fan of at all. I just want to play the funny pixel horse game and talk to people with similar interests as me.

- Art of mine is in my YT community. (I'll be allowed to get tumblr when I'm 16 so in the meantime that's where I post it)
