This person right here has attempted to defend blackface, tried to explain how shipping that heavily implies grooming of a minor until they were an adult was okay, defended calling p*dophiles "MAPS", lied about being a diagnosed system, and repeatedly called me a "bitch" even after I told them to stop many times because it made me severely uncomfortable. Please block and stay away. I also know this person in real life and have to, unfortunately, go to the same school as them. They also think they are an angel now after previously telling me they were meant to be born as a zombie/wolf hybrid. They've also poked and pricked at my religious trauma for the sake of their own sick amusement and because religion is their "special interest". Their manipulation got so bad it led to me self-harming. Please stay away from this person and, if you can, block and hide if you stumble upon them in Pony Town. They are also in a Cookie: Run Kingdom regiment as Pure Vanilla Cookie. If you are in that regiment, please be aware of the kind of person you have let in.
