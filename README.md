WARNING: I love you <3 You look awesome today btw.


My #1 pooksters, that are on GitHub:
- [@softtoyshark](https://github.com/softtoyshark) my beloved
- [@Pay2WinMyHeart](https://github.com/RBYI-DNC-NoINSPO-please) my beloved
  
  
By the way, visit my YouTube to see my art. I post a lot on the community and I also post CRK on YT Shorts some times. I'm planning on getting Tumblr once my parents let me :p. Until then, check out my YouTube to see sum art and stuff.

'BOUT ME:
- Hi, creatures, I'm Paggy or Pitaya. Both work just fine! o(*￣▽￣*)ブ
  
- Minor / hispanic / biligual (English and Spanish) / autism + ADHD are bouncing about and around in my noggin / I don't have a label for my sexuality. (Not something I see necessary to label, if I'm being frank. Also the fact I have better things to think about.)
  
- I go by "She/her", but while cosplaying a character that goes by other pronouns, feel free to address me as such pronouns! (≧∇≦)ﾉ

- Big Will Wood fan. I can go on for hours about his music. 🐀🎹

- I'm called "jesterlovingfreak_24" or "Paggygeek" in other socials, so if you find someone with those names, it MIGHT be me. Probably. :P

- My interests are: DnD, CR:K / CR:OB, Deltarune, Undertale (and the AUs too), FNaF, history, marine animals-- especially Orcas!

- I like to write, draw, read, and sew. (o′┏▽┓｀o)


PONY TOWN STUFF:

- I roleplay a lot. I like to say I'm experienced with all forms of roleplaying across different platforms, but really I've just been roleplaying online since I was around 9.ヾ(≧▽≦*)o

- Feel free to interact with me on Pony Town. If I don't respond, I'm probably afk because I like having Pony Town running in the background while I do schoolwork or while I write. So, if that's the case, just whisper me! ヾ(•ω•`)

- C + H is A-OKAY with me! Even if I don't have it in my name! And even if you're not my friend! >u<

- If you ever see me bullying someone, it's likely a friend, especially friends of mine like Lotus <3


KIN-LIST:
- Erm, usually I put like a long list of characters that are socially awkward and introverted and sarcastic, but lately I guess I've grown into a different person and now kin characters like Pitaya Dragon Cookie or sumthin. So, yeah, I'm having to scrap my kin list just because I realized I don't relate to the same characters as before. *prolongued sigh* (ToT)/~~~
  
- Also, btw, my nickname isn't Pitaya because I happen to kin a character named Pitaya. I've always been called Pitaya by folks (っ´Ι`)っ


SHIPS:
- Shadow Milk Cookie x Eternal Sugar Cookie (ShadowSugar): 10/10. TV girl reference. The moment Eternal Sugar comes out, I will be drawing so much fanart. You don't even KNOW.

- Error!Sans x Ink!Sans (GlitchSquid or Errorink): 8/10. Enemies to lovers. Fight me, but I like it. GRAH!!! /silly. I do head canon both as asexual, so I like to imagine their relationship is more non-sexual fluffiness than anything.

- Spamton x Jevil (Spamvil): 10000/10. Why does Spamton's name come first in the ship name? Blud is NOT the top /j. Love it. Two clinically insane creturrs kissing and hugging.
